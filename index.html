We’re in one of the galaxy’s four spiral arms. <br>Our solar system is the only one known to support life. So far, we only know of life on Earth, but NASA is looking for more.<br>Out of all the planets and some asteroids in our Solar System combined, hold more than 200 moons within their orbits!<br>Our Solar System is a region of space within the Milky Way galaxy which their is estimated to be over 100 billion planets.
