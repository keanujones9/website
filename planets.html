        Mercury is the closest planet to the sun as well as the smallest planet in our Solar System. It is also one of the fastest planets as it completely orbits the sun in 88 Earth days. It also rains diamonds on this planet sometimes!
        </p>
    <p id="para5">
       Venus is the second planet in our Solar System. Venus also slows spins in the opposite direction to most planets in our system. Venus is also one of the hottest planets due to to a thick atmosphere which traps heat.

        Earth which is our home planet is the third planet in the Solar System. It is the only planet in our Solar System which has liquid water on the surface as well as being the only planet that is inhabited by living beings.

    <p id="para7">
       Mars is the fourth planet in our Solar System. The planet is kind of like a desert as it is cold and dusty. It is once believed that billions of years ago that Mars had a thicker atmosphere which made it wetter and warmer and potentially may have hosted life.

        Jupiter is the fifth planet as well as the largest planet in our Solar System . It is more than twice as big as all of the other planets in our Solar System combined! (The red spot you can see on the image is a storm which is bigger than Earth which has been going on for centuries.)

    <p id="para9">
       Saturn is the sixth planet of our Solar System and one of the better looking planets with the nice icy rings around it. Like Jupiter, Saturn is also essentially a massive ball of gas mainly comprising of hydrogen and helium. Saturn is also not the only planet to have rings, but no others are as complex or look as nice ass Saturn's.

        Uranus is the seventh planet in our Solar System and is classed as an ice giant. Uranus rotates nearly at 90 degress which makes it look like it's spinning on it's side unlike the rest of the planets
        </p>
    <p id="para11">
       Neptune is the eighth planet from our Solar System and the furthest planet from the sun. Since this planet is so far away from the sun it is also classed as an ice giant as it is cold and dark as well as having hypersonice winds that range from 700-1200 mph!
